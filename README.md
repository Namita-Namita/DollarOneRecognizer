# HCIRA_Project1_Part4

Goals and Details:
The goals of Part 4 of Project #1 are for you to do the following (continuing from the same code base you wrote in Parts 1 and 2):
a) update your GUI canvas code to write the gesture the user draws to a file; 
b) add prompts to the user to draw 10 samples of each gesture type one at a time (and write them to files); 
c) recruit 6 people to provide gesture samples for your project; and 
d) submit your full dataset.
